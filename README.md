**Description of Use Case- Anisha**

As novel writers go through the drafting process, their document undergoes continuous changes ranging from basic word processing, such as cutting/pasting, markup, and formatting, to reorganizing and revising blocks of text, to even trying out multiple alternative story lines. Often times, this process can span months to years, racking up countless versions. Therefore, managing prose in text files presents itself as a compelling use case for a version control system, such as Git.  

**Why is it a good use of version control (Git/Github)- Adam**

Drafting a Novel has numerous benefits to realize with version control. The main benefit is the ability to track every change the author or their editors "commit" that makes to the drafts, this helps with chapter rewrites and general editing from multiple editors. This benefit is increasingly helpful in situations with multiple authors and contributors. Version control also helps with backups of writing drafts. This enables a level of security to ensure the authors work is adequately saved. In regards to a book with multiple coauthors, the "merge" function provides a tool for parts of the book to be written simultaneously and then combined in an efficient way. This aids several individual writers combine multiple chapters to assists in the novelâ€™s composition. Finally, the biggest benefit is tracking "writing experiments". Writing experiments is a literary tool to test alternative story lines. Using a version control software, any changes or rewrites to the main document can first be done in a "sandbox" or alternate environment. This ensures a controlled process to add, change, or remove parts from the writing draft. Overall, there are several benefits to using a version control software to write a novel, all of them are useful and help make the process of writing a novel more efficient.

**Where does it fall short in leveraging version control tools?- Tracey**

In using version control for novel writing, you are only getting to use a small portion of the benefits of a version control system. Version control is widely used by software developers to provide a platform where multiple developers can work on the same project. Git, in particular, is a distributed version control system, DVCS, that allows many independent developers to have their own full version of the repository. Let's say there is a team of 20 developers, of those 10 are working on new features for a major level release, the other 10 are dedicated to answering complaint tickets from customers on other existing versions of the software program.  Each developer can work in the appropriate version of the software, making changes, fixes, new features, etc without upsetting the work of the rest. This really isn't leveraged in novel writing.  There are typically not multiple authors. At most, you have editors that may be checking latest versions for edits. Another benefit of version control that you don't really leverage in our use case of novel writing is the use of an open-source platform. In software development, you have the ability to put your software on an open-platform that allows others to make a copy of your repository and build on that work.  You can harness the power of multiple sets of eyes.  In novel writing, authors are not typically keen on having their material available to the general public, let alone allow that public to make changes, additions, etc.  

**What would you do differently?- SP**
In multiple author scenario- Having branches to invoke and experiment with authors vision although a boon, can sometimes create unncessary diversions from the primary authors principle concepts that forms the basis of the novel. It would be good to have a feature that lets owner (in this case the parimary author) to set some pieces in stone i.e., uneditable. This helps preserve the integrity of the novel and enhances the workflow. 
Chapter/ characters management- It is critical for writers to balance the mood and characters in each chapter to create as well as sustain interest in the reader. This might be particularly difficul to achieve when dealing with hardcopies of manuscripts (unless it involves several post-it notes/ color coding etc. ) and having a VC with valuable options like header and optional extended descriotion for commit changes helps dealing with this issue in a seemless manner. Author can use this commit feature to balance the tension and characters as the novel undergoes numerous iterations by looking at the bird eye view of the structure. 

***Each member of a team must perform a 'commit'***


***Each member of a team must perform a 'pull request'***


***You must use a 'branch' for each section of the document***
