**Description of Use Case**

As novel writers go through the drafting process, their document undergoes continuous changes ranging from basic word processing, such as cutting/pasting, markup, and formatting, to reorganizing and revising blocks of text, to even trying out multiple alternative story lines. Often times, this process can span months to years, racking up countless versions. Therefore, managing prose in text files presents itself as a compelling use case for a version control system, such as Git.
